Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is well known to be an important neuromodulator in
the CNS; however, its modulatory actions on pain or nociception are bidirectional depending
upon various subtypes of 5-HT receptors (Lopez-Garcia, 2006)

According to these reports, 5-HT triggers depressant effects on synaptic transmission limiting the release of neurotransmitters from afferent terminals or the responsiveness of NMDA receptors located in dorsal horn neurones. These mechanisms are most likely mediated by 5-HT1 receptors. In contrast, 5-HT2 receptors seem to mediate excitatory effects such as depolarisation, increased excitability, and neurotransmitter release. The role of 5-HT3 receptors is less clear as they could mediate excitatory or inhibitory effects, depending on variables such as concentration of 5-HT or the state (sensitised/unsensitised) of the spinal cord.

expression of mRNA of several serotonin (5-HT) receptors is increased including of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 at both 1 h and 4 h after treatment.  mRNA levels of 5-HT2C, 5-HT4, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 are significantly increased in the DRG at 4 h after bee venom injection, whereas levels of 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT5A remain unchanged
